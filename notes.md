# Todo list

TODO: add train chuga chuga sound when a route is finished
TODO: shorten the dice roll animation
TODO: add the dice roll animation to the LandClaims action. this will likely require reworking the turn phase states

TODO: add a pending dialoge when a trade offer is in progress. all players should see the trade, but only the recipient should be able to accept or reject it

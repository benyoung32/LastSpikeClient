# Todo list

TODO: add train chuga chuga sound when a route is finished
TODO: shorten the dice roll animation
TODO: add the dice roll animation to the LandClaims action. this will likely require reworking the turn phase states

TODO: it should be more obvious when a player gets a property card, either a notification in the corner or a card popup

TODO: game balance options. scandal maybe should be only minus 5k or 7k. land spaces could become track spaces once the deck is empty, although this would require refactoring the rule engine.boost money when there are less players than 4 players in the lobby. potentially there should be 300k or so money total, divided evenly between players.
